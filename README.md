## Project Idea
[TheSoundProject](TheSoundProject)

Genrating realtime midi music using openv hand tracking model. Refined and made efficient using multiprocessing & image-processing.

Also included a training app, made with python kivy, to help people understand what areas of the grid play what notes.
